This solution was built using visual studio community 2015 version 2.

It utilizes a localDB database, which is in the folder ContestEntry/Database/
In the same folder you can find SQL scripts describing the tables used

The application utilizes entity framework with a database first development strategy for model management
and MVVM light for model-view and view management

A class called DataAccessService controls the interaction between the model-view and entity framework

Everything is sorted into folders for easier navigation
